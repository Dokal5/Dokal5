- ⚡ Fun fact: - ⚡ Fun fact: I once participated in a month-long workshop in Japan focusing on the art of pricing in traditional markets. I learned the age-old practice of 'Ichibai Kinsei,' where merchants adjust prices based on a customer's interest level, leading to a lively negotiation culture. This experience profoundly influenced my approach to modern pricing strategies.
